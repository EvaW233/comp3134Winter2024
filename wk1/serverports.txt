- What is the definition of a server port?
A server port is a specific endpoint on a computer, identified by a 16-bit number, used to host services or applications that can be accessed over a network. This numeric identifier, combined with an IP address, facilitates the proper routing of data to the correct service or process running on the device.

- What is the server port range?
The server port range refers to the entire range of port numbers available for use on a server or computing device. Port numbers are 16-bit unsigned integers, covering a range from 0 to 65535. This range is divided into three main categories: well-known ports (0-1023), registered ports (1024-49151), and dynamic or private ports (49152-65535).

- How many bits does the number above represent?
The number 65535 represents a 16-bit value. The 16-bit number is derived from the fact that the port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer, allowing for a total of 2^16 (or 65536) possible values.
